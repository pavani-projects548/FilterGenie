FilterGenie: Smart Log Filtering Assistant

**FilterGenie** is a Streamlit-powered smart assistant designed to simplify the process of log filtering and visualization. Built for the Splunk Build-a-Thon 2025, this tool empowers users to analyze log files with the help of ML-driven filter suggestions, real-time simulated log streaming, and data visualization features.

# Features

* **ML-Based Filter Suggestions**: Predicts likely severity levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.) based on query history using a Random Forest classifier.
* **Manual Filtering**: Allows users to filter logs by severity levels and view only what matters.
* **Visual Analytics**: Dynamic bar chart (by severity) and line chart (logs over time).
* **Query History Tracking**: Automatically logs past filters for future model training.
* **CSV Export**: Save filtered logs for further reporting or audit.
* **Simulated Real-Time Logs**: App supports live log stream simulation.

 How to Run

 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/pavani-projects548/FilterGenie.git
cd FilterGenie


 2. Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the App
